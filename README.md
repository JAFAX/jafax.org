# jafax.org

Website framework for Jafax.org's website.

The app name, buyo, is named after a traditional style of Japanese dancing
called Nihon Buy≈ç, a form that is meant for entertainment. As the framework
for this is based on Perl's excellent Dancer framework, and JAFAX is an
event to entertain (and educate) about Japanese culture through Anime and
other activities, it seems to fit as a theme.
