            Do you want to learn more about how the history of Japan influences
            the anim&eacute; and manga you enjoy? How about how women have shaped many
            of the events that shaped the Land of the Rising Sun? Or, hear how
            our guests discuss topics related to voice acting and how they got
            into the industry? Then stop in on one of the panels at JAFAX!

            of that topic? Come share your knowledge and creativity with your fellow
