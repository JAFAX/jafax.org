        <p>
            JAFAX takes the health and safety of everyone who attends our
            event, including our staff and volunteers, very seriously. JAFAX
            staff will continue to monitor the situation and any updates will
            be posted on this page.

            JAFAX encourages and recommends the use of face masks in indoor
            spaces of the convention to reduce the risk of spreading infectious
            diseases such as COVID-19.

                The JAFAX team thanks all of our 2022 attendees for supporting
                us and taking actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We
                couldnâ€™t have held a safe convention without you and we look
                forward to seeing you back again for 2023!
