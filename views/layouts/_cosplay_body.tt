        <center><h1>Cosplay Events at JAFAX 2020</h1></center>
        <p>
            For several years now, JAFAX has welcomed a diverse array of
            cosplayers to the event, and hosted a Cosplay Contest to award
            creativity and performance. If you've ever thought you'd love
            to dress up as your favorite character from anime, games, or
            manga, we'd love to see your fandom brought to life!
        </p>

        </p>
        <h4>JAFAX Cosplay Crafting Competiion Rules and Information</h4>
        <p>
            <b>Day of Show:</b> Sunday<br />
            <b>Time of Show:</b> late afternoon<br />
            <b>Location:</b> Grand Gallery, A-C
        </p>
        <h4>Rules</h4>
        <p>
            This contest is solely based on craftsmanship. All costumes must
            be at least 70% handmade/crafted by the costume artist. This
            includes props, wigs, and clothing. Store-bought costumes are not
            allowed to participate. If you are entering a commissioned costume,
            the original creator of the costume will receive the award, not
            the model.
        </p>
        <p>
            We, the judges, reserve the right to turn down any applicants who
            do not meet these requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Costumes that are allowed to participate must fall into one of
            these categories:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>Anime/Manga (Japanese Origin, including RWBY and Avatar,
                the Last Air Bender)</li>
                <li>Video Game (Japanese Origin)</li>
                <li>Japanese Media (Live-action, kaiju, J-rockers, etc – but
                you MUST have reference)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Because this is a Japanese Oriented Expo/Convention, we are
            limiting eligible costumes to <b>media of Japanese origin.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><em>
            Outfits not eligible are: Japanese fashion, Fan-made characters,
            Original Characters, American Animation/Comics, or On Ice.
            </b></em>
        </p>
        <p>
            You must provide reference of the character/person you are
            cosplaying as. Pictures should be in color, and provide a good view
            of the character you are representing. Official art/Screencaps only
            – no personal design sketches or fan art are allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
            All images should be copies/printouts on 8.5”x11” paper (or
            smaller), so that we can keep it with us to judge you. Don’t bring
            in books or figures, as useful as they are, we can’t hold onto them
            after all entrants have been interviewed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>If you do not have a reference image, we cannot judge you.</b>
        </p>
            Pictures of your creation process are also encouraged, but not
            required.
        </p>
            All costumes will be judged prior to the masquerade, according to
            a specific set of guidelines (see below). Judging will be by
            appointment only, and if you are unable to make your appointment,
            we cannot judge you! If you are excessively late, you risk being
            disqualified. Please contact us if you have any scheduling
            problems!
        </p>
        <p>
            Registration will begin online, closing June 5th. Whatever spots
            are left open at the time of the convention will be available for
            “at convention” registration. An “at convention” registration spot
            is NOT GUARANTEED.
