However, there ARE similarities: both fight with swords for pay, both run their mouths, both have beautiful love-of-their-lives, and sadly, both look the same beneath their masks/headwraps!</p><p>Samurai Dan and his lovely lady Jillian teach sword and self defense classes, give informational panels, perform stage shows, and do almost anything else to ensure that con-goers enjoy themselves.</p><p>Be sure to like them at <a href=\"www.facebook.com/SamuraiDanAndJillian\">their Facebook page</a>!"
