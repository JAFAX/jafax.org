  "content": "<p>Today, JAFAX is excited to announce Samurai Dan and Jillian as guests for this year!</p><p>He's the merc with the mouth and his swordplay always comes with maximum effort... wait; it's not who you think it is! However, there ARE similarities: both fight with swords for pay, both run their mouths, both have beautiful love-of-their-lives, and sadly, both look the same beneath their masks/headwraps!</p><p>Samurai Dan and his lovely lady Jillian teach sword and self defense classes, give informational panels, perform stage shows, and do almost anything else to ensure that con-goers enjoy themselves.</p>"
