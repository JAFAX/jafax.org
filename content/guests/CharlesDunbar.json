This was only the first of many instances when the Universe decided to troll him hardcore for his obliviousness.</p><p>After spending years attending his local SF con, Charles began attending anim&eacute; cons in earnest in 2007, bumping them up drastically while undertaking fieldwork for his MA in Anthropology, where he researched and wrote on fandom, convention culture, and the changing dynamic of anim&eacute; fan practices.</p><p>He never stopped attending, coming back year after year to both indulge his love of anim&eacute; conventions, and educate his fellow fans on all manner of mythology, Japanese sacred culture, fan cultures, and whatever else grabs his interests.</p><p>He is currently working on a series of short books based around his lectures, writing yokai stories, and adapting his lectures for YouTube.</p><p>You can read his ideas and ruminations at <a href=\"http://www.studyofanime.com\">studyofanime.com</a> or via <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/studyofanime/\">Facebook</a>.</p>"
