After deciding (on the road back from a con, no less) to study con culture back in 2008, they have spent the next decade of their life devoted to not only Japan (and its history, monsters, and culture) but to building their own base of knowledge from which they can draw and teach others. Since then, they have lectured at over 150 cons (including Anime Boston, from 2010-2014, before a triumphant return in 2017!), libraries, and universities on all manners of fandom, history, culture, and folklore, and anything else that strikes their fancy, in hopes of bringing new perspectives and points of view to the appreciation of Japanese animation, and everything else associated with it. You can keep track of their ramblings on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/studyofanime/\">Facebook.com/StudyofAnime</a> or via Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TenguTalks\">@TenguTalks</a></p>."
